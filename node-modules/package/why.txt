installed packages are stored in node-modules folder

that package's description ( name,version etc etc) stored in the package.json and package-lock.json of the current project directory


Versioning Rules=> x.y.x==> major.minor.patch
            
            
            1)When you fix a bug and the code stays backwards-compatible you increment the
            patch version.
            For example 1.1.1 to 1.1.2
            
            2)When you add new functionality but the code still stays backwards-compatible,
            you increment the minor version
            You also reset the patch version to zero
            For example 1.1.1 to 1.2.0
            
            3)When you make changes and the code is no more backwards compatible, you
            increment the major version
            You have to reset the minor and patch version to zero
            For example 1.1.1 to 2.0.0.


            Semantic versioning always starts with 0.1.0

            O.Y.Z (a major version of zero) is used for initial development

            When the code is production-ready, you increment to version 1.0.0

            Even the simplest of changes has to be done with an increase in the version
            number

    Versioning also uses some symbols before version like "^2..2.2" or "*2.2.2" etc


Local vs Global modules=>
                        
                        Local packages are installed locally in the porject folder like upper-case package
                        but sometime we need to install global package to use it on our all project or need to use it on terminal

                        Global package are those packages that will be install directly on our PATH directory so we can use it on terminal (eg=> NODEMON)
                         to install global package =>
                                                     npm install -g NODEMON 
                                                     npm uninstall -g NODEMON
                

Scripts=> 
            An npm script is a convenient way to bundle common commands for use in a project
            They are typically entered in the command line in order to do something with the
            application
                        
            npm scripts are stored in a project's package.json file, giving access to everyone who
            has access to the codebase=> it define few keywords that we will run and will run another functionality without diving on how to use that functionaltiy

            They also ensure that everyone is using the same command with the same options
            Common use cases for npm scripts include building your project, starting a development
            server, compiling CSS, linting, minifying etc
            npm scripts are executed using the command   npm run <SCRIPT NAME>

            eg=>  npm run abc
             in package.json=>  "scripts": {
                                    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
                                    "abc":"node index.js"
                                }
                so abc will run => node index.js which will run the file index.js and function Hello() inside it


We can publish our own NPM packages in few steps
